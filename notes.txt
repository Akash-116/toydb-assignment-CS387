CS631 Assignment.  Jan 24, 2019.

This is a multipart assignment. 

You are given a physical layer library (pflayer) that provides a "page" abstraction over disk files, where each page has an ID and represents a 4K-sized disjoint chunk of bytes on disk. A file is thus a collection of such blocks. 

-- 1: Load data  ---------------------------------------
Write a tuple layer on top of this layer, to be able to store and retrieve rows of data. You will be given the data in the form of a comma-separated file (.csv) in the following format. The first row contains the names and types of each column, and the rest of the rows contain actual data separated by commas.

Here's a sample data file. 
country:string,  population:int, capital:string
India, 133920000000, New Delhi
Mongolia, 3080000, Ulan Bator
...etc.

The data type can be one of 

These are the steps in converting them to binary tuples.
   - read a row from the csv file
   - copy each field into a separate row, ensuring that ints are stored as 64-bit entities, and strings
      are stored as 

-- 2: Indexing & retrieval -------------------------------------------
You are given an access method layer (amlayer), which can create and store indices.
